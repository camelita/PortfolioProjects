# REST API to MySQL database using Python

# Overview 📚

A project for migrating data from REST API to MySQL database.

Sent HTTP requests to a REST API endpoint, formatted the data into a clean, tabular structure, and loaded them into a MySQL database using Python once again.

# Objective🎯
We want to display an up-to-date list of the English Premier League’s top goal scorers in a way that is easy for any football fanatic to understand at a quick glance.

This helps a football enthusiast stay updated on their favorite goal scorers, compare them to other goal scorers, and even observe any exciting trends over the course of the season.

# Technologies Used⚙️
os, pandas, requests, python-dotenv, MySQL-connector-python

# Error handling🚨
I added error-handling mechanisms for API connection errors, HTTP request issues, timeouts & other potential errors.

# Key takeaway🔑
It is possible to load data from a REST API into an RDBMS database by combining Python and SQL together instead of using one over the other.
